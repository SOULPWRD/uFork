<h2 name="reuse">Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h2>
<p>
    Both code and data structures in uFork are immutable.
    This makes it safe to share these structures among actors.
    We can take advantage of commonality
    to reduce our memory footprint,
    and also to pass information efficiently between actors
    (without making copies).
</p>
<p>
    When two or more actors need access to the same mutable state,
    we define a &ldquo;state holder&rdquo; actor for that state.
    Since shared data is immutable,
    the state-holder maintains the mutable state privately,
    and the sharing actors coordinate
    by sending messages to the state-holder.
    We will define a &ldquo;storage cell&rdquo; actor
    as a simple state-holder example.
</p>
<h3 name="tail">Common Tail-Sequences</h3>
<p>
    In our previous examples,
    you may have noticed
    that the code for many actors
    ends with the some of the same instructions.
    Almost all actors end with
    an <code>end commit</code> instruction.
    Many actors preceed this with
    an <code>actor send</code> instruction.
    A common pattern is to send to a <em>customer</em>
    provided as <code>msg 1</code>.
    These patterns are so common,
    they are provided in the
    <a href="https://ufork.org/playground/?src=https://ufork.org/lib/std.asm">std.asm</a>
    module (usually imported with an <code>std</code> prefix).
</p>
<pre class="code">
; Common Tail-Sequences

cust_send:                  ; msg
    msg 1                   ; msg cust
send_msg:                   ; msg cust
    actor send              ; --
sink_beh:                   ; _ &lt;- _
commit:
    end commit
</pre>
<p>
    It may come as a surprise that these instructions
    may not be sequential in memory.
    In fact, there is no way to tell
    if they are sequential or not!
    This is because uFork memory is organized
    into linked structures called <em>quad-cells</em>.
    Quad-cells are the minimum addressable unit.
    They have 4 <em>value</em> fields.
    Each value is a <em>fixnum</em>,
    a <em>capability</em> (actor address),
    or a <em>pointer</em> to a quad-cell.
    There is no conversion between these types,
    thus you can't determine the numeric value of an address.
    The code fragment above is illustrated by this diagram:
</p>
<pre class="graphic">
cust_send ---> [#instr_t, "msg", 1, k]
                                    |
               +--------------------+
               |
               V
send_msg ----> [#instr_t, "actor", "send", k]
                                           |
                                           |
sink_beh ------+---------------------------+
               |
               V
commit ------> [#instr_t, "end", "commit", #?]
</pre>
<p>
    This code fragment consists of 3 instructions
    and occupies 3 quad-cells.
    This first field of each quad
    designates the type of the quad,
    in this case <code>#instr_t</code>
    for executable instructions.
    The labels <code>cust_send</code>, <code>send_msg</code>,
    <code>sink_beh</code>, and <code>commit</code>
    denote pointers to these instruction quads.
    The final field of each quad
    contains a pointer to the next instruction
    in the code sequence (the <em>continuation</em>),
    regardless of where it resides in memory.
</p>
<p>
    By default,
    the assembler translates a sequence of instructions
    into a linked-list of quad-cells.
    However, the continuation
    can always be specified explicitly
    by including an extra argument
    at the end of an instruction.
    For example,
    <code>cust_send</code> could be written as:
</p>
<pre class="code">
cust_send:                  ; msg
    msg 1 send_msg          ; msg cust
</pre>
<p>
    A more common approach is
    to use a <a href="https://github.com/organix/uFork/blob/main/docs/asm.md#ref"><code>ref</code></a> pseudo-instruction
    to provide the continuation,
    as shown here:
</p>
<pre class="code">
cust_send:                  ; msg
    msg 1                   ; msg cust
    ref send_msg
</pre>
<p>
    A <code>ref</code> can also be used
    to introduce a named constant.
    The following code associates the label <code>E_OK</code>
    with the fixnum value <code>0</code>.
</p>
<pre class="code">
E_OK:                       ; not an error
    ref 0
</pre>
<p>
    A <code>ref</code> occupies no storage.
    It's just a reference to another value.
    You should use <code>ref std.commit</code>
    instead of <code>end commit</code>
    to avoid creating redundant instruction-quads.
    The <code>send_msg</code> and <code>cust_send</code>
    labels allow sharing of longer common tail-sequences.
    Watch for opportunities to use them.
</p>
<h3 name="static">Static Data</h3>
<p>
    We will use the <code>ref</code> mechanism
    to define a set of operation-codes,
    and then use the <code>dict_t</code> data constructor
    to define a dictionary of code-addresses.
</p>
<pre class="code">
read_op:
    ref 0
write_op:
    ref 1
CAS_op:
    ref 2

op_table:
    dict_t read_op read
    dict_t write_op write
    dict_t CAS_op CAS
    ref #nil
</pre>
<p>
    The <a href="https://github.com/organix/uFork/blob/main/docs/asm.md#data"><code>dict_t</code></a> data constructor
    defines statically-initialized instances
    of type <code>#dict_t</code>.
    It takes a <var>key</var>, a <var>value</var>,
    and an optional <var>next</var> pointer.
    As with instructions,
    if the final <var>next</var> pointer is missing,
    it defaults to the next statement in the source code.
    The <code>#nil</code> value
    represents the empty dictionary,
    which terminates the sequence.
    Note that the named constants
    (<code>#?</code>, <code>#nil</code>, <code>#f</code> and <code>#t</code>)
    are <em>pointers</em> to read-only memory.
</p>
<h3 name="dispatch">Method Dispatch Table</h3>
<p>
    We begin defining the &ldquo;storage cell&rdquo; behavior
    by using the staically-defined <code>op_table</code>
    to dispatch to the code specified by the <code>op</code>
    selector in the incoming message.
</p>
<pre class="code">
beh:
cell_beh:                   ; value &lt;- cust,op,args
    push op_table           ; op_table
    msg 2                   ; op_table op
    dict get                ; op_code
    dup 1                   ; op_code op_code
    typeq #instr_t          ; op_code is_instr(op_code)
    if_not std.abort        ; op_code
    jump                    ; --
</pre>
<p>
    If the dictionary lookup produces a code-pointer,
    we <code>jump</code> to the selected method.
    Otherwise, the actor transaction is aborted.
    The message is discarded
    and there is no effect on the actor or the system.
    On some platforms,
    an &ldquo;auditor&rdquo; may be notified
    and the anomaly can be reported.
</p>
<h3 name="read">Read Method</h3>
<p>
    The method code is executed in the same transaction,
    with the same message and the same private state
    as the method dispatch.
    The &ldquo;read&rdquo; method simply sends the current <code>value</code>
    to the <code>cust</code> provided in the message.
</p>
<pre class="code">
read:                       ; value &lt;- cust,#read,_
    state 0                 ; value
    ref std.cust_send
</pre>
<h3 name="write">Write Method</h3>
<p>
    The &ldquo;write&rdquo; method updates the cell's private state
    with a new <code>value'</code> from the message,
    and sends its own address to the provided <code>cust</code>.
</p>
<pre class="code">
write:                      ; value &lt;- cust,#write,value'
    msg -2                  ; value'
    push cell_beh           ; value' cell_beh
    actor become            ; --
    actor self              ; SELF
    ref std.cust_send
</pre>
<p>
    Sending the actor's address to the customer
    is the &ldquo;sync signal&rdquo; pattern.
    It allows the customer to continue processing,
    knowing that the write has been completed.
</p>
<h3 name="CAS">Compare-and-Swap Method</h3>
<p>
    You might think that &ldquo;read&rdquo; and &ldquo;write&rdquo;
    are all the operations you need
    for a mutable storage cell.
    However, consider trying to do something
    as simple as incrementing a shared counter.
    This requires a read-modify-write cycle.
    With only a read/write API,
    the cell's value could change
    between the read of the original value
    and the write of the modified value.
    This is called a
    &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition#In_software">data race</a>&rdquo;.
    One mechanism to avoid this kind of hazard
    is to add a
    &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare-and-swap</a>&rdquo;
    operation to the API.
</p>
<pre class="code">
CAS:                        ; value &lt;- cust,#CAS,old,new
    msg 3                   ; old
    state 0                 ; old value
    cmp eq                  ; old==value
    if_not read             ; --
    msg -3                  ; new
    push cell_beh           ; new cell_beh
    actor become            ; --
    ref read
</pre>
<p>
    The &ldquo;CAS&rdquo; method request message provides
    the expected <code>old</code> value
    and the desired <code>new</code> value.
    If <code>old</code> matches the current <code>value</code>,
    then the cell's private state is updated to <code>new</code>.
    In either case, &ldquo;CAS&rdquo; acts like &ldquo;read&rdquo;
    (literally reusing the same code),
    sending <code>value</code> to <code>cust</code>.
    Note that, by definition, this is the <code>value</code>
    before any updates.
</p>
<p>
    If the &ldquo;CAS&rdquo; <code>cust</code> receives
    the <code>old</code> value they expected,
    they know the operation was successful.
    Otherwise, they can use the returned value
    as <code>old</code> and retry the operation,
    possibly with a recalculated <code>new</code>.
    With actors, nothing blocks
    and everyone makes progress,
    even when there is contention.
    The one-at-a-time transactional nature
    of actor event handling ensures consistency.
</p>
<h3 name="usage">Usage Example</h3>
<p>
    An actor with <code>cas_add</code> behavior
    uses a cell's &ldquo;CAS&rdquo; method
    to safely update the cell's value.
    The actor's state includes
    the expected <code>old</code> value
    (initialized to <code>#?</code>),
    the <code>inc</code>rement to add,
    and the <code>cell</code> holding the value.
    It receives the cell's
    updated <code>old'</code> value
    as the customer of a &ldquo;CAS&rdquo; operation.
</p>
<pre class="code">
cas_add:                    ; old,inc,cell &lt;- old'
    state 1                 ; old
    msg 0                   ; old old'
    cmp eq                  ; old==old'
    if std.commit           ; --
</pre>
<p>
    If the <code>old'</code> value received
    matches the expected <code>old</code> value,
    the operation was successful
    and there is no more work to do.
</p>
<pre class="code">
    state 0                 ; old,inc,cell
    part 2                  ; cell inc old
    drop 1                  ; cell inc
    msg 0                   ; cell inc old'
</pre>
<p>
    Otherwise,
    we replace the <code>old</code> value
    with the updated <code>old'</code>.
</p>
<pre class="code">
    dup 2                   ; cell inc old' inc old'
    alu add                 ; cell inc old' new=inc+old'
    pick 2                  ; cell inc old' new old'
    push CAS_op             ; cell inc old' new old' #CAS
    actor self              ; cell inc old' new old' #CAS cust=SELF
    pair 3                  ; cell inc old' cust,#CAS,old',new
    state -2                ; cell inc old' cust,#CAS,old',new cell
    actor send              ; cell inc old'
</pre>
<p>
    Then we recalculate <code>new=inc+old'</code>
    and prepare another &ldquo;CAS&rdquo; request
    for the <code>cell</code>,
    designating ourself as the customer.
</p>
<pre class="code">
    pair 2                  ; old',inc,cell
    push cas_add            ; old',inc,cell cas_add
    actor become            ; --
    ref std.commit
</pre>
<p>
    Finally,
    we update our private state
    and commit the transaction.
</p>

<p>
    The module exports <code>beh</code>,
    rather than <code>cell_beh</code>,
    so when the module is imported
    with a namespace prefix of <code>cell</code>
    it can be referenced as <code>cell.beh</code>
</p>
<p>
    The module also defines
    demonstration and testing procedures
    which are a subject for future tutorials.
